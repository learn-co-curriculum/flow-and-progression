## Thoughts to Keep in Mind with Lessons

When we think about the learning journey students take, we want to be very thoughtful about the material they encounter and how to maintain both consistency but also present new scenarios and situations that’ll challenge and test them. 

As you work through the lessons and labs in your units, think of a couple of narrative domains that you can use across your labs. For example, when we cover Rails, a lot of our labs cover the domain of creating a blog and creating an Airbnb clone.  When we cover Ruby, a lot of our labs will cover a music playlist app domain or more simply, a lot of labs will deal with the domain topic of students and classes. These  labs will build cumulatively across various units and give a sense of consistency that’s important for online learners.

At the same time, we also include other, usually more difficult labs that cover domains students haven’t encountered before since we want them to be able to practice their coding skills across a variety of scenarios and situations. 

At the end of each unit, you should have a few of these more difficult labs. 

## Questions to Keep Asking Yourself

As you’re reviewing your outline, think about the following questions:

Does the course have a logical, smooth progression for students?

Do your units and lessons give a complete sense of the skills that a student will need to actually work as a developer in the topic?

How can you ensure that the flow of your Readmes and Labs keep students engaged and challenged? For example, with more difficult concepts or units, how can you keep a student’s momentum going without making the labs and information presented too easy?
